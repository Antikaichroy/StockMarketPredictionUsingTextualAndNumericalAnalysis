# Stock Market Prediction Using Textual And Numerical Analysis
In this project, I delved into the intricate relationship between stock prices and news headlines through a comprehensive hybrid model. The objective is to perform a detailed numerical analysis of Sensex stock data spanning from 2015 to 2024 and conduct a robust textual analysis using news headlines data dating back to 2001.

# Approach:

1. Numerical Analysis: We utilized statistical methods to predict stock prices based on historical Sensex data from 2015 to 2024. This analysis includes examining trends, patterns, and statistical correlations to forecast future stock prices.

2. Textual Analysis: Sentiment analysis was applied to news headlines data starting from 2001. By evaluating the sentiments expressed in these headlines, we assessed their potential impact on stock prices, providing a qualitative layer to our analysis.

3. Hybrid Model Development: The core of the project is a hybrid model that merges the predictions from both the numerical and textual analyses. By integrating statistical forecasts with sentiment-driven insights, the model aims to predict stock closing prices more effectively. This approach involves using the sentiment scores derived from news headlines to adjust and refine the stock price predictions.

# Conclusion

From the analysis conducted, it is evident that the RandomForestRegressor is the most effective model for predicting stock closing prices. The model achieved a Mean Squared Error (MSE) of 0.05246, indicating its strong performance in capturing the underlying patterns of the stock data.

For the numerical analysis component, the Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) is 0.03, which reflects the high accuracy of our statistical predictions. This low RMSE demonstrates that our numerical analysis effectively forecasts stock prices with minimal error.

Given these results, we can confidently conclude that the hybrid model, combining RandomForestRegressor and sentiment analysis, performs excellently. The successful integration of these methods has led to accurate predictions and a robust model, marking the successful completion of the project.
